My name is Marcus Vinicius, but you can just call me Marcus. I'm studying Systems Analysis and Development at EstÃ¡cio de SÃ¡ University. Personally, I turn a well-known phrase into a professional dilemma: Programming is an art, and the programmer must be an artist. In addition to bits and bytes, I like:

- Games ðŸ•¹
- History ðŸ“š
- Philosofy ðŸ§ 
- Movies ðŸŽ¦

And so much more!
